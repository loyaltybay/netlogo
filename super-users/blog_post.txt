I love Netlogo. Even since I discovered it a few years ago I keep coming back to it just to play around with what's possible. If you don't know what Netlogo is, think of it as language/environment for building simulations. It allows you to create artificial worlds consisting of <i>patches</i> and <i>turtles</i>. You can think of these as simulated tiles on the ground and little people, respectively. You can then easily program and observe pretty much any behaviour you can think of. Here are some examples:

1) create 1000 turtles and have them move randomly around the world. When 2 turtles meet, they can either breed or fight.
2) simulate a population of ants foraging for food and laying pheromone trails that attract other ants to a pile of food
3) build a simulated social network and allow information to propagate through it.

These example just scratch the surface, and if you install Netlogo there is a large library of examples which illustrate what can be achieved.

Although it's fun to build such things and watch them run (die, little minions!), the real power of Netlogo is in its ability to generate data for further analysis. Any running Netlogo model can produce live charts of any variable within the program, but you can also output time series data for any variable to a text file. We can get data about lots of repetitions for a particular model using different starting parameters - this allows us to do higher level analysis to figure out how the simulation performs under different conditions.

One of the most interesting models that comes packaged with Netlogo is called Ants
